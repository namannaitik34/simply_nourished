      <h2>Our story & philosophy</h2>
      <p class="lead">Simply Nourished began as a small practice rooted in the belief that sustainable wellbeing grows from gentle, consistent habits. We prioritize balance over perfection and deep nourishment over restrictive trends.</p>
    </section>

        <h3>What we believe</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Food is information — enjoy variety and rhythm with seasons.</li>
          <li>Self-care is daily, small, and cumulative.</li>
          <li>Mindful routines help you return to what matters.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>How we work</h3>
        <p>We blend practical nutrition frameworks with mindset tools and small habit engineering. Programs are supportive and personalized through simple templates and trackers.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

      <h3>About modern diets — sugar & processed food</h3>
      <p>Nowadays, the sugar content in many packaged foods is alarmingly high, even in items marketed as healthy. Breakfast cereals, flavored yogurts, and many condiments often contain hidden sugars that shift energy levels, mood, and metabolic responses. The Nourish approach doesn't demand complete avoidance of sweetness. Instead, we help you understand where sugar appears, how it affects your body, and how to make more balanced choices. Favor natural sweeteners like whole fruits, dates, or a touch of honey when appropriate, and learn to read labels so that sweetness doesn't sneak into your daily habits unnoticed.</p>
    </section>

      <h3>About nourishment — our philosophy</h3>
      <p>True nourishment goes beyond counting calories or demonizing macronutrients — it's about listening to your body, feeding it with care, and maintaining consistency. Our philosophy centers on small, meaningful habits: adding color to your plate, staying hydrated, prioritizing sleep, and creating mindful pauses throughout the day. These incremental changes compound into dependable routines that support strength, clarity, and calm energy. When you nourish instead of restrict, you create a sustainable relationship with food and self-care.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Lifestyle Reset — why this matters</h3>
      <p>In a culture of fast food, fast scrolling, and quick fixes, wellness is often treated as something instantaneous. The reality is different — lasting change is slow, intentional, and personal. The 100-Day Nourish Plan exists because we need a gentle framework that prioritizes habit-building over instant results. The plan offers daily templates, weekly reflections, and simple trackers so that small, consistent actions (a nourishing breakfast, a short walk, or five minutes of journaling) accumulate into meaningful transformation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Mindful living — encouragement</h3>
      <p>Nourishment includes the food you eat and the meaning you bring to each choice. Slowing down to breathe before a meal, choosing water instead of a sugary drink, or preparing a simple home-cooked plate are all powerful acts of self-care. Each intentional decision sends the message "I care for you" to your body. This practice is compassionate, not punitive — progress is a series of small, steady steps, not perfection overnight.</p>
